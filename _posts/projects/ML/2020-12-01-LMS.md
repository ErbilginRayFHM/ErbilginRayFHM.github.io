**Skills**: Python, Jupyter, Matplotlib, Pandas, Self-training. 


**Description**: In this project, I wrote python code to train a program on how to play tic-tac-toe through indirect learning experience by itself, using the fundamental least means square learning rule as described in the classic Machine Learning textbook by Tom M. Mitchell. 

The program can learn how to play the game on boards of any size, and is essentially impossible to defeat since it always learns to play optimally.

**Skills**: C#, Unity, Visual Studio, Maya, Blender, Object-oriented Design, Animation, Joystick Setup.

**Description**: I created this small prototype of a parkour footrace game for [Maker Faire Hyderabad 2019](https://hyderabad.makerfaire.com/), where we at GBit studios were given a booth to showcase our work. The event was a big success for us in terms of marketing, since everyone who visited our booth was impressed by our completed and ongoing games/projects. We were even interviewed by a local news channel during the event.

**Description**: I developed this app with a team of two other NIT Warangal students during a hackathon in Fall 2019. The app eases the attendance taking process for teachers or professors to take roll-call in their lectures, as compared to the traditional roster technique. Using Google Firebase as its backend, the app provides features such as secure login, easy management of registered classes, and quick attendance taking via a mechanism similar to that of Tinder's 'Swipe Theory'.
